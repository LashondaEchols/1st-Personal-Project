  Im Lashonda Echols I’m a senior at Central high school I plan to go to college or to the army after high school. I want to go to a HBCU I don’t want to stay here because I don’t think there is anything here for me in the city of Detroit maybe if I was coming back to Detroit to get back to my city.
