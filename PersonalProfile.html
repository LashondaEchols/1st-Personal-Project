            Opening Statement: Im Lashonda Echols I’m a senior at Central high
            school I plan to go to college or to the army after high school. I
            want to go to a HBCU I don’t want to stay here because I don’t think
            there is anything here for me in the city of Detroit maybe if I was
            coming back to Detroit to get back to my city.

            <p>
            In two years I see myself in college still and also having a job
            dealing with being a pilot or a web designer or either working in
            human resources.
          </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            In five years I see myself either finishing up college or already
            being in the career I want to be in. I end up being a pilot , web
            designer or working in human resources because when I go to college
            in 2020 I will major in something dealing with either the three
            careers I’m interested in than when I major in one of my choices I
            will be sure about my career path afterwards I will stay on my
            classes making sure I create health study habits and great
            organization work ethic skills and just regular organization skills.
            After I have my schedule down packed I will be good to go leading me
            to my great life path and I will graduate from college.
