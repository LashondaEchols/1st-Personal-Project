<p>
  In five years I see myself  either finishing up college or already being in the career I want to be in. I end up being a pilot , web designer or working in human resources because when I go to college in 2020 I will major in something dealing with either the three careers I’m interested in than when I major in one of my choices I will be sure about my career path afterwards I will stay on my classes making sure I create health study habits and great organization work ethic skills and just regular organization skills. After I have my schedule down packed I will be good to go leading me to my great life path and I will graduate from college.
