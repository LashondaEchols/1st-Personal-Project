      I plan to go to college or to the army after high school. I want to go to
      a HBCU I don’t want to stay here because I don’t think there is anything
      here for me in the city of Detroit maybe if I was coming back to Detroit
      to get back to my city. List of hard skills: My hard skills are coding
